						<h1>UX Designer, Coding Enthusiast and Passionate Dog Walker</h1>
						<p>
							 Webdevelopment and UX design, to me, mean total immersion and flow. The more I have learned since I got started, the more I got to love it and the more I wanted to learn. Now, more than ever, good design and communication through online presence impact everyday decision-making. I studied translation, hoping to make an impact through the facilitation of communication. My workday did not permit me to learn and grow as much as I had hoped. Having been creative and enthusiastic about learning and putting my knowledge into practice, I quickly realized I could do more. Software has always been a focal point of interest, web development, up until now, only a side-project. Over the last couple of years I have been inspired on so many occasions to venture into uncharted territory and do more in the field of web development that I could no longer ingore my urge to follow my curiosity.

										<h1>More than just a web developer</h1>
										<p>I love browsing the web looking for the latest web designs and I love downloading applications with features that make me smile or stare in amazement, because the loading screen is more interesting than any average app I download on the go. A good website creates a visceral response. Good design touches the heart. I want to tell stories, help people reach their goals and make useful programs more accessible for people like you and me. I walk dogs for my local animal shelter, because their stories touch my heart. Revamping their outdated and malfunctioning website is a way I love to be able to create meaningful and useful designs. I love being able to save people time, money and generally just to everyday things easier to use. </p>

								<h1>This is what I am currently up to</h1>
								<p>
									During summer and early autum of 2017 I worked my way into programming more complex webapps, learning new techniques like CSS Grid and Animate.css, studied literature and lectures on UX/UI and programming and intensified my coding practice in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Java. I attended the <a href="">Railsgirls Frankfurt Workshop</a>, a RheinMainJS Meetup and made a lot of great new aqcaintances. Have a look at my portfolio, my <a href="https://github.com/programina">GitHub</a>page or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amina-belabbes-b98703149">LinkedIn</a> profile.
